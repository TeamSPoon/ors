The bag_of_words.py module can be run offline (i.e. before agent communication)/ at a pre-processing stage.
When run, it generates file named <ontology>_bag_of_words, whose lines have the following format:

SUMO_concept (word)+ number_of_words

e.g. Sword  weapon long blade covered handle weapon sword 7



The semantic_matcher.py file 

1) reads the Planning Agent's bag of words from the above file, 
2) retrieves information about the Service Providing Agent's concept through the URI that the concept is annotated with.
   (We assume that the URI is a URL here.)
3) outputs a ranking of the concepts in PA's ontology that are considered more relevant to the SPA's concept.
   (relevance is defined as similarity in the Vector Space Model)
