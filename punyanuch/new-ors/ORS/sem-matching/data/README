The python files 

-- parse_ontologies.py 
-- parse_wordnet.py 

were used to generate the text files next to them, namely 

- all_words
- docum_subcl_inst
- sumo_wordnet
- synsets_info      [synset (its_hypernym_synset)* (its_words)+ | gloss]
- words_n_synsets


The first python file will also serve as a module from which we will import function definitions for later use.

To run the python files as stand-alone programmes (as opposed to modules), the user needs to navigate to the directory were these files are placed.
